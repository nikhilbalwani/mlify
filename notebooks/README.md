# MLify Notebooks

Welcome to the notebooks section of this project.

The goal is to implement Machine Learning Algorithms in Python Notebook Format. The notebooks are annotated to make it easier for readers to acquire an in-depth knowledge of these algorithms. All the algorithms are implemented using Numpy without using tools like Autograd so as to reinforce a stronger understanding of the inner-workings.
